<h2>Launch Academy Hive Mind</h2>
<p>The other day, I stumbled onto Dan Murphy and Rory Quinlan working partials into their views for one of the challenges.</p>
<p>They showed me how to do it and I had a cool new trick to use...</p>
<p>But something bugged me about the random encounter.</p>
<p>All around the room, every day, people are figuring out stuff like this. We've all been working on the same core curriculum, but depending on your approach and what else you add to the challenges, you have to figure out things that are just a little bit beyond the core, but still within reach when you dig a little deeper.</p>
<p>So how can we surface all these cool little insights and share them with each other?</p>
